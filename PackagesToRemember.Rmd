# Packages to Remember **EARLY DRAFT**
What packages to I want to remember? Examples from each.

In general, I'm seeking to stay in the tidyverse for effieciency; venturing out when there are compelling reasons to do so.

## Ingest

```{r}
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(haven)
```
## Process/Transform
```{r}
library(dplyr) 
library(broom)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
```

## Visualization
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(DT)
```

### Dimensional Data
The ridgeline library `r library(ggridges)` makes adding ordered data easy. 
```{r}

## Presentions
*Markdown
*Word
*PowerPoint
*Shiny
```{r}
library(shiny)

```
